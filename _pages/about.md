<h3>Areas of Expertise</h3>
<p>My expertise spans several domains within AI:</p>

- **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI):**
I’m fascinated by the fusion of neuroscience and technology. BCI allows us to decode brain signals and create direct communication pathways between the mind and machines.

- **Biomedical Signal Processing:**
Analyzing physiological signals (such as EEG or ECG) to extract meaningful information is a crucial aspect of healthcare. I’m passionate about developing signal processing techniques for medical applications.

- **Medical Image Processing:**
Medical imaging plays a pivotal role in diagnosis and treatment. I explore image segmentation, feature extraction, and deep learning methods to enhance medical image analysis.

- **Deep Learning:**
Neural networks are at the heart of AI. I’ve worked on various deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).


<h3>Research Interests</h3>
My ongoing research projects include:

BCI Algorithms: Investigating novel algorithms for real-time brain signal classification and decoding.

Healthcare Applications: Applying AI techniques to medical data, such as predicting disease outcomes or automating diagnosis.
