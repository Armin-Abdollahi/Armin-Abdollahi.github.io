# Armin Abdollahi
**MSc in Artificial Intelligence | NeuroAI Researcher | Head Teaching Assistant**

I am an AI researcher driven by a fascination for the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence and Human Cognition**. Currently, I serve as the **Head Teaching Assistant** for the Deep Learning course, where I lead a team of TAs and bridge advanced theory with large-scale implementation.

My primary research focuses on **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)**, specifically leveraging **Transformer-based architectures** to decode complex neural signals. I am passionate about creating robust AI systems that can interpret human intent for neuro-rehabilitation and beyond.

## 🔬 Research Focus & Expertise
My academic journey is defined by a blend of rigorous signal processing and state-of-the-art deep learning:

* **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI):** Developing high-accuracy decoders for imagined speech and motor imagery.
* **NeuroAI:** Applying architectural principles from the human brain (like attention and recurrent loops) to AI models.
* **Medical Computer Vision:** Expertise in clinical diagnostics, exemplified by my work on **Vision Transformers (ViT)** for automated bone age estimation.

## 🎓 Academic Journey

### **Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence**
*Azad University, Tehran North Branch*
* **Thesis:** "Developing Transformer-based Deep Learning models for Signal Decoding in BCI."
* **Distinction:** Achieved a **Perfect Grade of 20/20** for my Master's thesis defense.
* **Leadership:** Selected as the **Head TA** for the Deep Learning course, managing curriculum development and student assessments.

### **Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering**
*Roshdiyeh University*
* Focused on software orientation, building a solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, and systemic programming.

## 📚 Beyond Research
I believe in bridging the gap between global research and the local community. I am proud to have translated the seminal work **"Brain-Computer Interface Research: A State-of-the-Art Summary"** into Persian, making cutting-edge BCI knowledge accessible to Persian-speaking students and researchers.

## 🚀 Future Aspirations
I am currently seeking **Ph.D. opportunities** in Europe (specifically Switzerland, Germany, and the Nordic countries). My goal is to join a lab where I can contribute to the next generation of **Neuro-AI** systems and further explore the "Illusion of Accuracy" in neural network diagnostics.
