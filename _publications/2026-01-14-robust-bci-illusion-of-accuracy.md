### Research Contribution:
This paper investigates the **robustness** of deep learning models in clinical settings. We found that while CNNs achieve high "apparent" accuracy, they are often sensitive to artifacts. By using **Explainable AI (XAI)** and **RSA**, we show that our **Transformer-based** approach is more robust and truly decodes the patient's intent, making it a reliable solution for neuro-rehabilitation.
