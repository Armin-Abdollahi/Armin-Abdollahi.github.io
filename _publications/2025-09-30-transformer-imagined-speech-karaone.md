This work represents my Master's thesis, which received a **perfect score of 20/20**. 

### Highlights:
- Utilized the **KARA ONE** dataset for multi-class imagined speech classification.
- Implemented a **Transformer** model to capture long-range dependencies in EEG time-series data.
- Demonstrated that self-attention mechanisms are superior to traditional convolutions for non-stationary neural signals.
