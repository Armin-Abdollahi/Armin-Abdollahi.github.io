### Abstract
This research addresses a critical flaw in current BCI models: the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to achieve high accuracy by learning non-neural artifacts (like ocular or muscular noise). Using **Saliency Maps** and **Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA)**, we demonstrate that **Transformers** focus on actual neural features, providing a safer and more reliable path for clinical neuro-rehabilitation.

**Key Findings:**
- Identification of "False Accuracy" in traditional BCI models.
- Superiority of Transformer architectures in multi-class imagined speech decoding.
- Implementation of XAI techniques to validate neural feature selection.
