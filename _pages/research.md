## 🧠 Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)

### Transformer-based Signal Decoding (Master's Thesis)
**Summary:** Developing a state-of-the-art Transformer architecture for decoding imagined speech from EEG signals using the **KARA ONE** dataset.
* **Status:** Successfully Defended (Grade: 20/20)
* **Key Achievement:** Outperformed traditional CNN models by capturing long-range temporal dependencies in neural signals.

### The Illusion of Accuracy in Rehabilitation BCI
**Summary:** Investigating how deep learning models (CNNs vs. Transformers) interpret neural data versus artifacts.
* **Focus:** Using Saliency Maps and RSA to ensure models learn true neural intent for clinical rehabilitation.
